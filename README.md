# Micro Processor & Micro Controller Laboratory (x86)

This repository includes code samples demonstrating basic to advanced programming techniques in assembly language for x86 microprocessors. It also provides step-by-step guides on setting up development environments, writing and debugging assembly code, and interfacing with hardware.

## Getting Started
To get started with programming x86 microprocessors and microcontrollers, you'll need:
1. Assembler and Linker: Tools like MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler) for assembling and linking your code.
2. Emulator or Hardware: DOSBox for emulation or actual x86-based hardware to run your programs.

## Commands to run the code in the terminal : 

- Assemble the Code :
  ```
  masm filename.asm
  ```

- Link the Code :
  ```
  link filename.obj
  ```

- Debug the Code :
  ```
  debug filename.obj
  ```
